# Analysis Log

This is an honest chronology of how the methodology changed, including mistakes, negative results, abandoned approaches, and unresolved limitations—not just the latest preferred interpretation. It was reconstructed from available scripts, generated outputs, repository history, and one collaborator's conversation history; earlier work performed elsewhere may still be incomplete. Last substantially updated: **17 July 2026**.

## v1 — HYPERAKTIV, first pass

- Built a Monte Carlo simulation of a hypothesized dopamine D1/D2 + ATP-depletion mechanism, producing four fixed "theoretical centroids."
- Real HYPERAKTIV participants were assigned to the nearest centroid (z-scaled Euclidean distance) and compared via Mann-Whitney U.
- Initial result: "Decompensated Sprint" cluster, p = 0.0004, r = -0.582 (survives Bonferroni).

**Final corrected HYPERAKTIV run** (Clinical Control label, noise cluster fully dissolved, permutation test added): "Decompensated Sprint" gives U=193.00, p=0.0312, r=-0.462 (n=24 ADHD vs 11 clinical control) — this does **not** clear the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (0.0167), and the permutation test confirms this (empirical p = 0.0420, also above threshold). So on HYPERAKTIV this is a trend in the same direction as BALLADEER, not an independently significant result — see the "Where this stands" summary below for why this matters.

**Problems identified on review:**
- The comparison group was labeled "Healthy Control" but is actually HYPERAKTIV's *clinical* control group (other psychiatric diagnoses, not confirmed-healthy people).
- Circularity: centroids came from an untested simulated mechanism, not from real receptor/biological measurement; a within-cluster ADHD/control difference doesn't validate the mechanism, since RT variability and commission-rate differences are already well-documented ADHD markers on their own.
- The "entropy_paradox" (noise) cluster was explicitly designed to absorb ambiguous participants and clean up the boundary between the two hypothesized subtypes — a form of post-hoc boundary sharpening.
- Small per-cluster sample sizes; multiple analytic choices not accounted for beyond the cluster-count Bonferroni correction.

## Correction plan

1. Rename "Healthy Control" → "Clinical Control"; separate observed pattern from proposed mechanism explicitly in all text output.
2. Add a label-permutation test (shuffle ADHD/control labels, not cluster assignments) to properly account for pipeline flexibility.
3. Resolve/justify the noise-cluster exclusion criterion.
4. Find a dataset with genuine neurotypical (not clinical) controls for independent testing.

## BALLADEER — first run

- Identified BALLADEER (Trujillo, Ferrer-Cascales, Teruel et al., *Scientific Data*, 2026) as a dataset with true neurotypical controls and a CPT-like attention task (Nesplora AULA/AQUARIUM, "Attention Robots").
- First run revealed the dataset's own `group` field is not perfectly clean: within the nominal "Control" group, a separate `diagnosed` field showed a meaningful fraction coded `yes` or `undetermined` for ADHD (per the dataset's own data dictionary: `undetermined` = no formal diagnosis, but project psychologists suspected ADHD).

## BALLADEER — clean cohort run

- Rebuilt groups from the `diagnosed` field directly: Pure ADHD (`diagnosed == yes`), Pure Control (`diagnosed == no`), Suspected ADHD (`diagnosed == undetermined`, analyzed separately, excluded from the primary test).
- Results (Mann-Whitney U, Bonferroni-corrected across 3 clusters, α = 0.0167):
  - **Decompensated Sprint** (n = 20 vs 20): p = 0.011, r ≈ -0.465 — **significant**, confirmed by permutation test (empirical p = 0.014).
  - Compensated Crash (n = 28 vs 23): p = 0.443 — not significant.
  - True Resilience (n = 17 vs 33): p = 0.256 — not significant.
- PRV (pulse-rate variability) confirmed genuinely unavailable — NaN across every participant and every activity source in this export, not a script bug. The physiological "crash" mechanism remains untested, not disproven.
- EDA (skin conductance) change was examined descriptively as a substitute; no clear pattern distinguishing "Crash" from "Sprint" emerged, and no significance test was run on it — treat as inconclusive, not evidence either way.

## Testing the temporal-dynamics claim

- The original hypothesis also claimed the two subtypes diverge *over time within the task* (stable vs. progressively worsening). This was tested directly:
  - A pooled, cluster-free mixed model across all diagnosed ADHD participants came back flat (p ≈ 0.98). **This is not itself evidence that the two subtypes "cancel each other out" — that specific claim was proposed after the fact and was not tested directly, and was correctly rejected as an unfalsifiable post-hoc story.**
  - A direct test, restricted to Pure ADHD only (`commission ~ block × cluster`, Sprint vs. Crash), came back p = 0.847 — no support for differing trajectories. However, only 4 of the 20 "Sprint" participants had complete 4-block data (missing-data attrition), so this specific result is likely underpowered and should be read as inconclusive rather than a clean disproof.
- **Rejected approach:** after the flat result, a suggestion was made to either loosen missing-data filters or switch the outcome variable (to work-speed mean, then speed variability) until something crossed p < 0.05. This is a textbook significance-hunting pattern and was not pursued. If missing-data handling or alternate metrics are revisited later, the choice must be made *before* seeing results, and any additional metrics tested must be corrected for as additional comparisons.

## UCLA CNP — selecting a third independent test

Following the BALLADEER result and the HYPERAKTIV trend, the next priority was an independent dataset that would not reuse the same forced-anchor classification. Several constraints were imposed before selecting a dataset:

- Publicly accessible participant-level behavioral data.
- A genuine healthy-control group rather than a clinical comparison group.
- An ADHD sample large enough for a whole-group test.
- Trial-level response-inhibition data permitting independent recalculation of participant metrics.
- No requirement to download MRI data.
- A primary analysis that could be performed without assigning Sprint/Crash labels.

The selected dataset was **UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics / OpenNeuro `ds000030`**, distributed under PDDL. It contains multiple diagnostic groups and several tasks; only phenotype metadata and Stop-Signal Task event tables were required for the present analysis. This was explicitly treated as a **conceptual replication**, because an adaptive Stop-Signal Task is not equivalent to HYPERAKTIV CPT-II or BALLADEER's Attention Robots task.

Relevant sources:

- OpenNeuro: `https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000030/versions/1.0.0`
- Dataset repository: `https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds000030`
- Data descriptor: `https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.110`
- Anonymous object store: `s3://openneuro.org/ds000030`

## UCLA CNP validator — prespecified methodological changes

A new universal script, `UCLA_CNP_VALIDATOR.py`, was written for local terminals and Google Colab. It was designed as a reusable validator rather than a one-off notebook fragment.

### Data acquisition and safety

- Selective anonymous S3 retrieval via `boto3`; no Git clone or DataLad requirement.
- Downloads only tabular phenotype, metadata, and Stop-Signal event files.
- Safety gate excludes `.nii`, `.nii.gz`, DICOM, `bval`, and `bvec` files.
- Flexible event-schema detection with documented aliases.
- Supports `--data-dir`, `--output-dir`, `--no-download`, `--keep-data`, `--no-auto-install`, `--self-test`, and `--no-colab-download`.
- Downloaded raw tabular files are removed only after a successful run unless `--keep-data` is specified.
- A crash log is written if execution fails.

### Primary analysis

The UCLA primary analysis was deliberately **cluster-free**:

- All eligible ADHD participants were compared with all eligible healthy controls.
- No subtype labels were assigned before the group comparison.
- Participant metrics were calculated directly from trial-level events.
- Primary and supporting measures included median go RT, go RT MAD, go RT IQR, omission rate, and integration-method SSRT when the required stop-signal information was available.
- Group location was evaluated with two-sided Mann–Whitney U, rank-biserial effect size, bootstrap confidence intervals, and a median-difference label-permutation test.
- Group dispersion was evaluated with median-centered Brown–Forsythe tests.

### Secondary ADHD-only clustering

Clustering was made secondary and restricted to ADHD participants. To avoid repeating the BALLADEER outcome-circularity problem:

- Component features were only `median_go_rt_s` and `go_rt_mad_s`.
- Diagnosis, healthy controls, SSRT, stop accuracy, and other held-out outcomes did not define components.
- Gaussian mixture models with K = 1, 2, and 3 were compared.
- A two-component interpretation required **all** prespecified gates:
  - BIC improvement over K = 1 of at least 10;
  - K = 2 must have the best BIC among K = 1, 2, 3;
  - silhouette score at least 0.25;
  - each component at least 15% of the ADHD sample;
  - bootstrap median adjusted Rand index at least 0.60.
- Failure of any gate prevented a stable-two-cluster conclusion.
- No component was automatically named Sprint or Crash.
- SSRT was retained as a held-out validation measure.

The script used a fixed seed (`20260716`), 5,000 label permutations, and 500 bootstrap repetitions. Script version at the completed UCLA run: `0.1.0`.

## UCLA CNP — actual data retrieval and quality control

The completed Colab run retrieved **639 tabular/metadata files totaling 14.52 MB**—not the raw MRI dataset.

Metadata coverage:

- 272 participants represented in the retrieved metadata.
- 43 labeled ADHD.
- 130 labeled healthy control.
- 99 belonging to other diagnoses or otherwise outside the target comparison.

Eligible analysis sample:

- 41 ADHD participants.
- 126 healthy controls.
- Six metadata participants lacked usable scanner event files.
- No additional participants were excluded by the remaining implemented QC criteria.

Parsed event coverage:

- 266 scanner event files.
- 267 training event files.

Detected task columns:

```text
trial_type
ReactionTime
StopSignalDelay
SubjectResponseCorrectness
SubjectResponseButton
onset
```

The schema was recorded in the reproducibility output rather than silently assumed.

## UCLA CNP — cluster-free results

### Group location

| Metric | ADHD | Healthy control | Test result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Median go RT | 0.4768 s | 0.4481 s | p = 0.2817; permutation p = 0.1500 |
| Go RT MAD | 0.0602 s | 0.0612 s | p = 0.7281 |
| Go RT IQR | 0.1237 s | 0.1219 s | p = 0.8018 |
| Go omission rate | median 0 | median 0 | p = 0.3252 |
| SSRT | 0.2061 s | 0.2172 s | p = 0.7086 |

None of the examined whole-group location tests was statistically significant. ADHD median go RT was descriptively slower, but the uncertainty and p-values do not support a reliable group difference in this sample.

### Group dispersion

Median-centered Brown–Forsythe p-values:

| Metric | p-value |
|---|---:|
| Median go RT | 0.7661 |
| Go RT MAD | 0.3992 |
| Go RT IQR | 0.4803 |
| SSRT | 0.2037 |

These results provided no significant evidence that the ADHD group had greater dispersion than healthy controls on the examined Stop-Signal measures. This matters because a broad dimensional-heterogeneity account might predict wider ADHD distributions, but this dataset did not show that pattern on these variables.

## UCLA CNP — GMM result and rejected subtype interpretation

ADHD-only Gaussian mixture diagnostics:

| K | BIC |
|---:|---:|
| 1 | 201.47 |
| 2 | 183.90 |
| 3 | 199.13 |

Additional diagnostics:

- BIC improvement, K = 1 minus K = 2: **17.57** — passes the ≥10 gate.
- K = 2 had the best BIC — passes.
- Silhouette: **0.726** — passes.
- Bootstrap median ARI: **0.638** — passes.
- Minimum component share: **0.02439**, corresponding to one participant out of 41 — fails the required ≥0.15 gate.

Final decision:

```text
stable_two_cluster = False
```

Although several diagnostics looked strong, the smaller component contained only one person. It was therefore interpreted as an **outlier-like component**, not a behavioral subtype. Sprint/Crash labels were not assigned. This is an example of why a single favorable clustering metric is insufficient: BIC and silhouette can reward isolation of an extreme observation.

## UCLA CNP — interpretation

The UCLA result is a meaningful null conceptual replication:

- It does not support a broad task-general ADHD-control difference on the examined Stop-Signal measures.
- It does not support greater ADHD variance on those measures.
- It does not support two adequately sized, stable ADHD components.
- It does not prove equivalence between groups.
- It does not directly refute the BALLADEER commission-error finding, because the tasks and outcome structures differ.
- It constrains any claim that Sprint/Crash are universal, discrete, cross-task ADHD subtypes.

The correct interpretation is not that UCLA “failed.” The validator successfully tested a broader claim and returned a reproducible null result.

## Reformulation: discrete subtypes to dimensional behavioral space

The cumulative evidence no longer supports presenting Sprint and Crash as established, permanent, task-general categories. The working reformulation is a multidimensional behavioral space with partly independent axes:

1. Response speed.
2. Reaction-time or work-speed variability.
3. Commission-error propensity / disinhibited responding.
4. Omission propensity / inattention.
5. Stopping latency or inhibitory control.
6. Motor activity when independently measured.
7. Within-session deterioration or stabilization.

Under this formulation:

- “Sprint-like” and “Crash-like” describe possible poles or regions, not diagnoses.
- Most participants may occupy intermediate positions.
- A participant's position may depend on sleep, medication, motivation, stress, fatigue, task structure, reward, and time.
- Discrete clusters should be accepted only when they are sufficiently large, stable, independently validated, and not constructed from the outcome later used to validate them.
- A null cluster result should remain null; labels must not be forced.

Important boundary: UCLA CNP did **not** prove a dimensional spectrum. It rejected an acceptable discrete two-component solution on the examined features and left the dimensional/state-sensitive account as an exploratory next model.

## README update after UCLA CNP

The project README was substantially rewritten in English while preserving the existing DOI, status, peer-review, license, and Python badges. Additions included:

- UCLA CNP evidence and figures.
- An evidence-at-a-glance table covering BALLADEER, HYPERAKTIV, and UCLA CNP.
- Explicit separation of positive, nonsignificant, and null findings.
- A “From Discrete Subtypes to a Dimensional Interpretation” section.
- Updated methodology and clustering acceptance gates.
- Stronger interpretation boundaries.
- Explicit disclosure that dopamine receptor states, ATP depletion, and the proposed biological mechanism were not measured.
- A statement that the analyses are not diagnostic or clinical tools.

The README continues to report the historical BALLADEER result, but labels it task-specific and partially circular. UCLA figures were added without presenting descriptive block dynamics as a significant longitudinal interaction.

## Search for additional datasets

Several potential follow-up datasets were reviewed.

### ATTLAPSE

- 28 medication-naïve adults with ADHD and 28 healthy controls.
- Sustained Attention to Response Task / Go-No-Go structure.
- Behavioral performance, thought probes, ASRS, and 64-channel EEG.
- Scientifically close to the current question, especially for fatigue, motivation, mind wandering, and within-session state changes.
- Zenodo record: `https://zenodo.org/records/17314289`.
- Description and license are public, but files were marked restricted at the time of review; access must be requested.
- Exact file structure and availability of convenient trial-level behavioral tables have not yet been independently validated.

### OpenNeuro `ds003500`

- Response inhibition and selective attention in participants with and without ADHD.
- 12 children with ADHD, 15 age-matched child controls, and 11 adults.
- Twelve blocks of 18 trials, half go and half no-go.
- CC0 and fully open.
- Close to commission-error analyses but underpowered for a decisive test; better treated as a pilot exact-task replication.

### OpenNeuro `ds005899`

- Children with ADHD and typically developing controls.
- Cued Stop-Signal Task.
- OpenNeuro release includes 61 participants; the associated paper mentions a larger behavior-only sample of 50 ADHD and 37 typically developing participants.
- Full raw behavioral availability for the behavior-only sample remains uncertain.
- Useful but conceptually overlaps with UCLA's Stop-Signal construct.

### OpenNeuro `ds002424`

- 79 children, including 35 ADHD participants at the first time point.
- Working-memory and reward manipulation using multiple n-back tasks.
- CC0.
- Relevant to context dependence, cognitive load, and reward, but not a direct commission-error replication.

### Healthy Brain Network

- Large pediatric transdiagnostic resource with phenotypes, EEG, behavioral tasks, and other modalities.
- Particularly attractive for dimensional rather than binary subtype analysis.
- Phenotypic linkage requires a Data Usage Agreement.

### ABCD

- Very large longitudinal cohort with Stop-Signal and ADHD symptom measures.
- Requires controlled-access application through NDA/NBDC rather than frictionless public download.
- Known Stop-Signal design and QC issues require specialized handling.
- Considered a later, higher-complexity longitudinal test rather than the next low-barrier validator.

## HBN Quotient ADHD System Child request

An access request was submitted for the **Healthy Brain Network Quotient ADHD System — Child** data.

Why it is relevant:

- It combines a computerized sustained-attention task with motion tracking.
- It targets attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity together.
- Potential measures include response accuracy, commission errors, omission errors, latency, response fluctuations, and movement.
- Some Quotient implementations classify short time windows into proprietary attention-state categories.

Important limitations identified before access:

- HBN no longer administers Quotient, so coverage is likely restricted to an earlier subset.
- The released table may contain only proprietary summary scores rather than raw trials or 30-second windows.
- Proprietary `Attentive`, `Impulsive`, or `Distracted` labels must not be treated as independent confirmation of Sprint/Crash.
- Quotient alone may not contain diagnostic/control labels; participant IDs must be joined to HBN phenotype and diagnostic tables.
- Age, sex, medication status, symptom severity, and comorbid diagnoses must be considered.
- CPT-style scores should not be treated as stand-alone diagnostic evidence.

A preregistration-style document, `docs/HBN_QUOTIENT_PREREGISTRATION.md`, was created before receipt of the requested data. Any changes made after data access should be recorded as dated amendments rather than silently replacing the original plan.

## BALLADEER methodological correction — candidate v1.0.1

The unresolved circularity in the historical BALLADEER analysis became the next code target. A candidate replacement `HEALTHY_VALID_BALLADEER.py` was written with the following design:

### Primary cluster-free analysis

- Pure ADHD versus Pure Control without subtype assignment.
- Commission rate designated as the sole primary outcome.
- Two-sided Mann–Whitney U.
- Rank-biserial effect size.
- 5,000 label permutations for the median difference.
- 2,000 bootstrap repetitions for the median-difference confidence interval.
- Brown–Forsythe dispersion test.
- Secondary outcomes include omissions, accuracy, speed, and speed variability; secondary p-values use Holm correction.

### Independent dimensional analysis

- Component/dimension features are only work-speed mean and work-speed variability.
- Commission rate, omission rate, and accuracy are excluded from dimension and component formation.
- A principal speed/variability axis is calculated.
- ADHD-only Spearman associations relate independent dimensions to held-out behavioral outcomes.
- An HC3 robust OLS model evaluates diagnosis, speed, variability, diagnosis interactions, and available age/sex covariates.

### Secondary ADHD-only GMM

- K = 1, 2, and 3 compared by BIC.
- Two-component acceptance gates mirror the UCLA logic:
  - BIC improvement ≥10;
  - K = 2 best BIC;
  - silhouette ≥0.25;
  - minimum component share ≥0.15;
  - bootstrap median ARI ≥0.60.
- Components remain numeric exploratory components.
- The validator defines no Sprint/Crash subtype labels.

### Temporal and physiological checks

- Individual commission-rate slopes across blocks are related to the independent dimensional axis.
- Available EDA/PRV changes are analyzed dimensionally rather than as forced subtype bar groups.

Validation status as of 17 July 2026:

- Python syntax compilation passed.
- Static checks confirmed removal of active forced-anchor and nearest-cluster logic.
- The local sandbox lacked SciPy, preventing a complete runtime self-test there.
- A Colab attempt did not constitute a real test: the session contained an older validator and no BALLADEER dataset files. The error was a missing `users_demographics.json`, not a statistical or parser result.
- The complete BALLADEER dataset would need to be downloaded again because it is not mirrored in the project repository. That download was deferred.
- Therefore **no v1.0.1 BALLADEER numerical result exists yet**.
- The historical v1.0.0 BALLADEER numbers remain the only completed BALLADEER result and must not be silently replaced.

## Repository reorganization and reproducibility

The repository was reorganized to make active code, documentation, figures, and historical versions easier to distinguish.

Current intended top-level organization:

```text
docs/
images/
scripts/
CITATION.cff
LICENSE
README.md
analysis_log.md
requirements.txt
.gitignore
```

Repository actions completed or prepared:

- Active validators placed under `scripts/`.
- Original BALLADEER validator preserved under `docs/legacy/v1.0.0/` with an explanatory README.
- HBN preregistration placed under `docs/`.
- Figures moved under `images/`.
- README figure references updated to `images/...` paths.
- UCLA figures retained alongside historical BALLADEER figures.
- Dependency list expanded to include the libraries used across all validators, including `boto3`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`.
- Compatible version ranges were recommended rather than exact environment pins.
- The incorrectly named `d1.gitignore` was identified for renaming to `.gitignore`.

Recommended dependency ranges:

```text
# Supported Python: 3.10–3.13
numpy>=1.24,<3
pandas>=2.0,<3
scipy>=1.10,<2
matplotlib>=3.7,<4
seaborn>=0.12,<1
openpyxl>=3.1,<4
scikit-learn>=1.3,<2
statsmodels>=0.14,<1
boto3>=1.28,<2
```

A future `requirements-lock.txt` should be produced only after all active validators have been run successfully in one controlled environment. A lock file generated before that would imply a validation status that has not been achieved.

## Versioning decision

The current public release remains **v1.0.0**.

The planned next release is **v1.0.1**, framed as a methodological correction rather than a claim of new positive evidence. The release tag must be created only after:

1. The candidate BALLADEER validator is run on the complete real dataset.
2. Generated metrics and plots are inspected.
3. README numerical statements and badges are updated to match the result.
4. `analysis_log.md`, `requirements.txt`, and `CITATION.cff` are finalized.
5. The repository reproduces from the final commit.

The existing `v1.0.0` tag must never be moved or overwritten. Until the real BALLADEER rerun occurs, the new code should be described as **candidate**, **unreleased**, or **not yet validated on the complete source dataset**.

## Current evidence status as of 17 July 2026

### Supported, with a major methodological qualification

- The historical BALLADEER v1.0.0 analysis found a commission-rate difference in the Decompensated Sprint anchor-defined cluster: p = 0.011 and empirical permutation p = 0.014.
- This is task-specific and partly circular because accuracy/commission-related information contributed to defining the groups later compared on commission errors.
- It remains reportable as a historical result, not as clean confirmation of a biological subtype.

### Directionally consistent but corrected-nonsignificant

- HYPERAKTIV produced p = 0.0312 and permutation p = 0.0420 in the analogous cluster.
- It did not pass Bonferroni α = 0.0167.
- Its comparison group contains other psychiatric diagnoses and is not a confirmed-healthy control group.

### Null conceptual replication

- UCLA CNP found no significant ADHD-control differences in median go RT, robust go-RT variability, omissions, or SSRT.
- UCLA CNP found no significant evidence of greater ADHD dispersion.
- Its apparent two-component GMM solution failed the minimum-size gate because one component contained only one participant.

### Not supported

- BALLADEER Sprint-versus-Crash within-session trajectory difference: interaction p = 0.847, with substantial missing-block limitations.
- A task-general discrete two-subtype interpretation across all three datasets.
- A clear BALLADEER EDA signature separating proposed subtypes.

### Exploratory but unconfirmed

- A continuous, context-sensitive multidimensional behavioral model.
- Within-person movement through behavioral states over days, weeks, or months.
- HBN Quotient-based links between attention, impulsivity, motion, and time-varying state.

### Untested

- Dopamine D1/D2 receptor states.
- ATP depletion or metabolic exhaustion.
- A causal allostatic mechanism.
- Medication response prediction.
- Diagnostic or treatment utility.

## Pending analyses and decision rules

1. **Real BALLADEER v1.0.1 rerun:** do not update the main numerical claim until complete source data are available and the candidate validator finishes successfully.
2. **HBN Quotient:** inspect exact columns before analysis; distinguish raw/block-level data from proprietary summary scores; record any post-access amendments.
3. **ATTLAPSE:** if access is granted, inspect license, exact file list, trial-level behavioral structure, group mapping, and whether behavior can be downloaded without EEG.
4. **OpenNeuro `ds003500`:** suitable as a fully open, close Go/No-Go pilot, but interpret low power explicitly.
5. **Longitudinal hypothesis:** requires repeated within-person sampling; single-session block plots cannot validate weeks-to-months cycles.
6. **No outcome switching:** missing data, alternative outcomes, exclusion rules, and multiplicity corrections must be set before inspecting significance.
7. **No forced labels:** a failed stability or size gate remains a failed clustering result.

## Final interpretation boundary

At this stage the repository documents an evolving exploratory hypothesis, not a validated disease model. The strongest responsible summary is:

> BALLADEER produced one task-specific, methodologically qualified positive result; HYPERAKTIV produced a corrected-nonsignificant trend; UCLA CNP produced a substantive cluster-free null result. Together they do not support permanent, task-general Sprint/Crash subtypes. A dimensional and state-sensitive reformulation is reasonable to test, but remains unconfirmed. No molecular mechanism, diagnostic application, or treatment implication has been established.

Negative and inconclusive results are retained because they define the limits of the hypothesis and reduce the risk of presenting an exploratory narrative as settled evidence.
